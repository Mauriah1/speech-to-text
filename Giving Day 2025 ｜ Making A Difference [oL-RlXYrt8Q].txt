On Wednesday, March 5th, we will celebrate the great tradition of Giving Day, when Turks
from near and far come together for 24 hours to build opportunities at the University of
Maryland.
Your gift on Giving Day, no matter the size, has a real impact.
It fuels scholarships, clubs and organizations, academic departments, the arts, athletics,
and critical student services.
On Giving Day, please give to the campus cause that means the most to you, and move
the University of Maryland fearlessly forward.
Go, Turks!
