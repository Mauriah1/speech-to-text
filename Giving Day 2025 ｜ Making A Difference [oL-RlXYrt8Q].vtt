00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
On Wednesday, March 5th, we will celebrate the great tradition of Giving Day, when Turks

00:06.400 --> 00:11.880
from near and far come together for 24 hours to build opportunities at the University of

00:11.880 --> 00:13.040
Maryland.

00:13.040 --> 00:17.520
Your gift on Giving Day, no matter the size, has a real impact.

00:17.520 --> 00:24.600
It fuels scholarships, clubs and organizations, academic departments, the arts, athletics,

00:24.600 --> 00:27.120
and critical student services.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.320
On Giving Day, please give to the campus cause that means the most to you, and move

00:32.320 --> 00:35.680
the University of Maryland fearlessly forward.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.840
Go, Turks!
