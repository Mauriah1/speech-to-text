00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
On Wednesday, March 5th, we will celebrate the great tradition of Giving Day, when Turks

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,880
from near and far come together for 24 hours to build opportunities at the University of

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,040
Maryland.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,520
Your gift on Giving Day, no matter the size, has a real impact.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,600
It fuels scholarships, clubs and organizations, academic departments, the arts, athletics,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,120
and critical student services.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,320
On Giving Day, please give to the campus cause that means the most to you, and move

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
the University of Maryland fearlessly forward.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,840
Go, Turks!
