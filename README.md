I thought this assignment was pretty tideous but straight forward. There were a lot of things that were not downloaded on my end, and I went throught a lot of trail and error. My inital video had no sound really so I couldnt really tell if it transcibed it, so I switched videos and that video did a very good job at showing the task. One of my biggest insights I would say is that I had to gather an extension because Youtube doesn't allow you to share a video unless the platform accepts the cookies. This was very eye opening to me because this particular application cant accept the cookies so I had to go through many more steps to get it done. In the future, I probably wont be using this method as video transciption but it was a cool tool to leaern.
